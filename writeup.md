## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

We may have missing values or no data in the data set because the device may have been taken off at certain times and unable to record data. FIltering these values out may result in a less accurate dataset. 

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

The lowest maximum heart rate out of the phases is in phase 0 with a maximum of 60 bpm which indicates that the sleep may occur in this phase. On the line graph, the heart rate is also typically lower than in the other phases. 

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

The highest maximum heart rate out of the phases is in phase 2 with a maximum of 117 bpm which indicates that the exercise may occur in this phase. On the line graph, the heart rate is also typically higher than in the other phases. 

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

The lowest average heart rate and highest standard deviation occurs in phase 3. The average is 60.65 bpm and the standard deviation is 11. Although, the standard deviation is higher in phase 2, the average is not relatively lower.
